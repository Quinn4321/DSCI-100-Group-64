    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulsars or Pulse Stars are highly magnetized neutron stars that radiate radio-wave emissions of two opposing narrow beams of light that are spinning, which we perceive on earth as blinking (Cofield, 2016). Each pulsar star emits a different emission pattern that varies with each of its rotations, therefore whenever there is a signal detection, or “candidate”, it is averaged over several rotations of the pulse star (Lyon, 2017). Each of these candidates are potential descriptions of a real pulse star. Radio frequency interference and noise causes is responsible for most detections, the true pulse star signals are challenging to extract (Lyon, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data set includes pulsar candidate data. Using this data, we will attempt to predict which of these candidates are legitimate pulsar stars and which are not. Our question is thus: Can we differentiate legitimate pulsar stars from interference and noise using a classification model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Data set can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set includes 9 variables (9 columns), and approximately 18000 rows. \n",

    "    Individual pulses vary in shape, and their radiation is detected as individual photons which arrive infrequently (Lyne & Graham Smith, 2012). The timing of the pulse’s arrival also varies across different radio frequencies. The delay between frequencies is known as dispersion (Krishnan, 2020). \n",
    "    \n",
    "DM-SNR, or Dispersion Measure - Signal to noise ratio curves are created to adjust for the effect of these frequency delays (Krishnan, 2020). The variables 1-8 in this dataset thus describe the mean, skewness, standard deviation, and excess kurtosis of the integrated profile and DM-SNR curves. The Class variable refers to whether or not an observation is a pulsar star or not. 0 = the observation is not a pulsar star,  1 = the observation is a pulsar star.\n",

    "Our analysis determined that we could predict whether an observation was a pulsar star or not with 98.01% accuracy, which is very high. This suggests our model is very good, and that the predictive variables we used are strong predictive variables. We expected that K-NN Classification would be a useful method for determining if an observation is a pulsar star or not, in part because it requires few assumptions about what the data looks like. However, we did not expect our accuracy to be so high. This is potentially due to the large size of the dataset used; there were 13,423 observations in our training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings could be impactful because if a model is sufficiently accurate at predicting the class of an observation, then a model such as ours could be used in place of all-sky surveys, a method for using a telescope to find pulsar stars (Cofield, 2016). This would significantly reduce the effort required to identify pulsar stars.\n",

    "We expect that future potential questions might include the following:\n",
    "- Do more optimal configurations of predictive variables than we used in our analysis exist, and if so, what are they?\n",
    "- What are alternative ways we can predict the class of observations from potential pulsar star data, and how might those alternative methods change the accuracy of the predictions? \n",
    "- Are there other predictive variables we could obtain which would lead to better predictions of class? \n",
    "- Could we further classify non-pulsar stars into certain groups using this data?\n",
